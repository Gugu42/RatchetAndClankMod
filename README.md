RatchetAndClankMod
==================


This is repository is here for only 2 reasons :

Helping me to develop the mod ( Check here : http://www.reddit.com/r/RatchetAndClankMod/comments/1uyi28/howtohelp_with_the_mod/ )

Learning how to do what I have done in the mod ( Don't forget to ask me if you don't understand something )

If you intend to compile it and claim that you made it, I will call my 100 war monkeys and attack you !
